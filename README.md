# Cheems

Cheems is a communication platform allowing the users to connect via video conferencing
and text messaging. The project was built as a solution to the challenge described
during [Microsoft Engage 2021](https://microsoft.acehacker.com/engage2021/).

## Tech Stack

Cheems is built primarily on JavaScript. The following technologies were used to prepare
the whole project:

1. **Front-end**

   - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
   - [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
   - [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
   - [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
   
2. **Back-end**

   - JavaScript
   - Node.js
   - MongoDB (for database)
   
A few helper libraries such as [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/) were used to deal with
connection failures between server and client and between users. To maintain the code
quality and standards, developer tools (linters, formatters, and parsers) such as
[Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) were set up in place.
